// ReactElement is a type that represents a React element (i.e., an instance of a React component or DOM element) 
// in TypeScript. In the context of React, it defines the structure of the JSX you are working with, which gets 
// rendered to the DOM.
import { ReactElement } from "react";
// <Navigate />: This component is part of react-router-dom and is used for programmatically navigating to a 
// different route. Itâ€™s used here to redirect unauthorized users.
// <Outlet />: This is also a part of react-router-dom and is used to render nested routes. In this case, it's 
// used as a fallback if no children are provided, meaning that nested routes will be rendered when the conditions 
// pass.
import { Navigate, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

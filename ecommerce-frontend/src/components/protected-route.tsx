// ReactElement is a type that represents a React element (i.e., an instance of a React component or DOM element) 
// in TypeScript. In the context of React, it defines the structure of the JSX you are working with, which gets 
// rendered to the DOM.
import { ReactElement } from "react";
// <Navigate />: This component is part of react-router-dom and is used for programmatically navigating to a 
// different route. It’s used here to redirect unauthorized users.
// <Outlet />: This is also a part of react-router-dom and is used to render nested routes. In this case, it's 
// used as a fallback if no children are provided, meaning that nested routes will be rendered when the conditions 
// pass.
// How <Outlet /> Works:
// 1: Route Matching:
// **React Router uses the routing configuration to match the current URL to the route hierarchy.
// **If the current route has nested routes, the Outlet in the parent route’s component will render the matched 
// nested route.
// 2: Fallback Behavior:
// **If the children prop is provided, the ProtectedRoute component renders those children instead.
// **If children is not provided, the Outlet ensures that nested routes (if any exist) are rendered in its place.
import { Navigate, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

    // If adminOnly is true and isAdmin is false, the user is redirected to the redirect URL (or / if no redirect 
    // is specified).
    if (adminOnly && !isAdmin) return <Navigate to={redirect} />;
